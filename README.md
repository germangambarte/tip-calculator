# Tip and Consumption Calculator

This is a tip calculator application developed in React + TypeScript that allows users to select products from a menu, calculate the subtotal, and apply a tip based on a selected percentage (10%, 20%, or 30%). The app displays a consumption cart where items can be removed, with the total dynamically updated in real-time.
